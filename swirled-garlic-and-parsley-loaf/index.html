		<h1>Swirled Garlic & Parsley&nbsp;Loaf</h1>

		<p>I'm on a quest to find the <em>ultimate</em> garlic bread. Most kinds you get in a restaurant just aren't garlicky enough, which defeats the point if you ask me.</p>

		<p>This version is swirled with green butter spiked with so much garlic and parsley. The end result is a gorgeous little loaf that packs a huge punch of flavour.</p>

		<h2>Shopping list</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>4&ndash;6 cloves garlic (or more, I won't judge!)</li>
			<li>25g flat-leaf parsley (or 1 small bunch)</li>
			<li>120g unsalted butter</li>
			<li>8g fine salt (I use sea salt)</li>
			<li>Pepper, to taste</li>
			<li>330g strong white flour (plus more for dusting)</li>
			<li>1g instant dried yeast</li>
			<li>185g tap water</li>
			<li>Vegetable oil, for greasing</li>
			<li>Small loaf tin (enough for 500g of dough)
		</ul>

		<div class="tip"><p>All the specific quantities and ingredients are in each step of the method, so just use this list to check you've got everything you need before you start.</p></div>


		<h2>Method</h2>

		<div class="method-card">

			<div class="method-card_title"><p></p></div>

			<div class="method-card_body">

				<p>Start by getting out a small loaf tin, enough for around 500g of dough.</p>

				<p>Lightly grease the tin with vegetable oil (or any flavourless oil).</p>

				<p>Also, get <span class="ingredient">100g unsalted butter</span> out of the fridge to soften for the garlic butter.</p>

			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="method-card">

			<div class="method-card_title"><p></p></div>

			<div class="method-card_body">

				<p>Melt <span class="ingredient">20g unsalted butter</span> in a pan or a bowl in the microwave.</p>

				<p>Set the butter aside to cool slightly.</p>

			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="method-card">

			<div class="method-card_title"><p></p></div>

			<div class="method-card_body">

				<p>Add all the ingredients for the dough in a large mixing bowl:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><span class="ingredient">330g strong white flour</span></li>
					<li><span class="ingredient">8g fine salt</span> (about &frac34; tsp)</li>
					<li><span class="ingredient">1g instant dried yeast</span> (about &frac14; tsp)</li>
					<li><span class="ingredient">185g water</span> (room temperature)</li>
					<li><span class="ingredient">20g unsalted butter</span> you melted previously</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Mix all the ingredients with your hand or a wooden spoon to roughly combine.</p>

			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="method-card">

			<div class="method-card_title"><p></p></div>

			<div class="method-card_body">

				<p>You can knead this dough with a mixer or by hand.</p>

				<p>If using a mixer with dough hook, turn it to a slow speed for 4 mins, then medium speed for another 4 mins.</p>

				<p>If mixing by hand, turn the dough out onto a lightly-floured worktop and knead for around 8&ndash;10 mins, until smooth and springy.</p>

				<div class="tip">

					<p>To check the dough is mixed properly, take a golf ball-sized lump and stretch it out gently with your fingers.</p> 

					<p>You should be able to stretch it until you can see light shining through when you hold it up to a window.</p>

					<p>If it tears easily or resists stretching too much, it needs more kneading.</p>

				</div>

			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="method-card">

			<div class="method-card_title"><p></p></div>

			<div class="method-card_body">

				<p>Form the dough into a rough ball by stretching the edges out and gathering them into the middle. Do this until you form a tight, springy ball.</p>

				<p>Put the dough ball into a large bowl lightly greased with vegetable oil and cover the top with a damp teatowel or cling film so it doesn't dry out.</p>

				<p>Set a timer to leave the dough to rise for 1 hour.</p>

			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="method-card">

			<div class="method-card_title"><p></p></div>

			<div class="method-card_body">

				<p>While the dough rises, make the garlic and parsley butter using:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><span class="ingredient">100g unsalted butter</span></li>
					<li><span class="ingredient">25g flat-leaf parsley</span> (stalks and all!)</li>
					<li><span class="ingredient">4&ndash;6 cloves of garlic</span>, peeled</li>
					<li><span class="ingredient">&frac12; tsp fine salt</span> (or to taste)
					<li><span class="ingredient">Pepper, to taste</span></li>
				</ul>

				<p>First peel thencrush, grate or finely chop the 4&ndash;6 garlic cloves to extract maximum flavour.</p>

				<p>The easiest method is then to add the garlic with the other ingredients in a processor and pulse until very finely blended. You will need to scrape down the sides a few times.</p>

				<p>If you don't have a blender then finely chop the parsley, soften the butter and combine both with the garlic and salt and pepper to taste. Mix very well to combine. A pestle and mortar would work well here.</p>

				<div class="tip">

					<p>It's up to you how much garlic you add. I'm a firm believer that no amount is too much, so I'll never judge you for adding more!</p>

				</div>

			</div>

			<div class="method-card_body">

				<p>As the dough rises, you'll fold it a couple of times. This will improve its structure and help ensure it springs up as it bakes in the oven.</p>

				<p>After the dough has rested for 1 hour, turn it out to a lightly-floured worktop, then press and stretch the dough to a rough rectangle.</p>

				<p>Aim to get the dough at least &frac12;cm thin, but don't worry about being exact or making the rectangle a specific size.</p>

				<p>Imagine the rectange split into thirds. Fold the top third and then the bottom third over the middle third, like you're folding up a letter.</p>

				<p>Once folded form the dough into a rough ball and put back into the bowl seam-side down.</p>

				<p>Leave the dough for 1 hour more then add a second fold, exactly as before. Then, leave the dough to rest again for 1 hour.</p>

			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="method-card">

			<div class="method-card_body">

				<p>Turn the rested dough ball out to a lightly floured worktop.</p>

				<p>With a floured rolling pin, roll the dough to a rectangle measuring approximately 60cm long by 25cm wide.</p>

				<div class="tip">
					<p>If you've adjusted the recipe for a different size of tin, bear in mind you will want the width to be about 25% bigger than the long side of the tin.</p>

					<p>This is so that you can bunch up the dough nicely to create those all-important swirls.</p>
				</div>

			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="method-card">

			<div class="method-card_title"><p></p></div>

			<div class="method-card_body">

				<p>Set aside about 2 tablespoons (or 30g) of the garlic butter to glaze the bread after it has baked.</p>

				<p>Spread the rest of the butter all over the surface of the rolled out dough, so it is completely covered.</p>

				<div class="tip">
					<p>If you have extra garlic butter left over, lucky you! It keeps amazingly well in the freezer wrapped in greaseproof paper or foil. It's great added to roast potatoes!</p>
				</div>

			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="method-card">

			<div class="method-card_title"><p></p></div>

			<div class="method-card_body">

				<p>Working up the length of dough, gather it into folds taking about 10cm of dough each time and folding back and forth into a concertina.</p>

				<p>You should end up with a stack of dough folded 6 times, with 3 bumps along the long side of the stack. I fold mine so all the garlic butter is in folds along the top of the loaf.</p>

				<div class="tip">

					<p>Don't worry if yours doesn't look exactly like this. Every loaf will be subtly different &ndash; be confident yours will look and taste amazing and be uniquely your own!</p>

		</div>

		<div class="method-card">

			<div class="method-card_title"><p></p></div>

			<div class="method-card_body">

				<p>Gently tranfer the folded dough to a lightly-oiled 500g loaf tin, curving it to fit into the tin and create the swirled 'S' shape.</p>

				<p>If you don't like the look of your swirls, take the dough out and try again until you're happy. Try and make sure you can see all those lovely folds now so they don't get lost fighting for space as the dough rises.</p>

				<p>When you're happy, use a little of the reserved garlic butter to brush the top of the loaf so it's completely covered, then cover the top of the tin with a damp tea towel or lightly-oiled cling film.</p>

			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="method-card">

			<div class="method-card_title"><p></p></div>

			<div class="method-card_body">
		
				<p>Set the tin aside in a warm place for the final rise.</p>

				<p>After all the rolling, this dough may need up to 2 hours before it's ready for the oven. It should have at least doubled in size.</p>

				<p>Check on it after 1 hour and every 15&ndash;30 minutes after. How long this takes will depend on the temperature of the room where you are.</p>

				<p>While the dough rises, preheat the oven to 240&deg;c (220&deg;c fan or gas 9).</p>

			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="method-card">

			<div class="method-card_title"><p></p></div>

			<div class="method-card_body">	

				<p>When the loaf is ready to bake, remove the cling film and slide it into the preheated oven.</p>

				<p>Bake for 20 mins then turn the temperature down to 200&deg;c (180&deg;c fan or gas 8) and continue to bake for a further 10 mins.</p>

			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="method-card">

			<div class="method-card_title"><p></p></div>

			<div class="method-card_body">

				<p>Remove the loaf from the oven and, using oven gloves or tea towels, carefully turn the loaf out of the tin. The structure will still be delicate and the loaf very hot, so be careful!</p>

				<p>Return the uncovered loaf to the oven for a further 10 minutes to get hot air to the sides and base, then remove and set on a rack to cool.</p>

			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="method-card">

			<div class="method-card_title"><p></p></div>

			<div class="method-card_body">

				<p>Brush the top of the loaf with the reserved garlic butter straight out of the oven. It will melt and add another layer of intense garlic flavour!</p>

				<p>Try to leave the loaf to cool for at least 1 hour before slicing, if you can!</p>

				<div class="tip">
					<p>Once completely cold store the loaf in an airtight container.</p>

					<p>Slices are amazing warmed in the oven or cut into cubes and roasted into crunchy croutons for soup or a salad!</p>
